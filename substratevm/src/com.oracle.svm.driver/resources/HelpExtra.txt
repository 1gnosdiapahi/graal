    --dry-run             output the command line that would be used for building

    --bundle-create       in addition to building a native image create a bundle file (*.nib file)
                          that allows rebuilding of that image again at a later point.
    --bundle-apply bundle-file
                          an image will be built from the given bundle file with the exact same
                          arguments and files that have been passed to native-image originally
                          to create the bundle.
    --bundle-prepare      create a bundle file that allows building an image at a later point from
                          the bundle file but do not also build the image right away.
    --bundle-amend bundle-file
                          create a new bundle but use a given bundle as the starting point. Any
                          given extra arguments add to the arguments of the provided bundle and
                          are incorporated into the new updated bundle.
